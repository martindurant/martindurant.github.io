<h2>TL;DR</h2>
<p>Another one of my little hacks this last quarter. The code presented here
makes zarr the first async-ready pydata IO package. This might be important
if you are already using async code, but it's particularly a big deal
in the era of <a href="https://pyscript.net/">PyScript</a></p>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>I hope everyone is enjoying my catching up with blogging duties, describing
all the little side-projects I've done over the last few months. I should
maybe also write about my core activities sometime...</p>
<p>In this article, I'll first describe the two technologies involved here,
the two words of the title, and then how I am combining them. There is a
proof of concept in the linked repo at <a href="https://github.com/martindurant/async-zarr">https://github.com/martindurant/async-zarr</a> ,</p>
<h4>What is Zarr</h4>
<p><a href="https://zarr.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">zarr</a> is a library for n-dimensional array-oriented
IO. It is cloud-native, offering efficient concurrent and parallel chunkwise access
to data. The style of access is essentially numpy-like slicing, but a dataset
can contain a hierarchical tree of related arrays, perhaps (but not necessarily)
adhering to the netCDF data model. It has found a lot of use particularly
in earth science, climatology and microscopy, as well as other science and engineering
fields.</p>
<p>Zarr is a very nice clean and simple implementation. The code is very approachable,
as, as we see here, <em>hackable</em>.</p>
<p>Because zarr can optionally do its IO over fsspec, in the case that you access many
chunks of data in an array at once, those chunks will be fetched concurrently
behind an async barrier.</p>
<h4>What is async</h4>
<p>Asynchronous programming is a pattern in which most of your code is waiting
on some external stimulus most of time time. Thus, you can queue up many
downloads concurrently, and then process the packets as they come in, rather than
waiting for one stream to end before starting the next one. This is ideal for
a predominantly IO library like zarr, but not well supported in the
rest of the pydata landscape. It is far more common a pattern in server applications,
where processing typically happens as a response to incoming requests. Note:
the tasks happen on a single thread with an event loop - this is not the same
as parallelism.</p>
<p>With the arrival of <a href="https://pyscript.net/">pyscript</a> this year has upended everything!
When running in the browser, all code is essentially running async, and any
(HTTP) binary communications <em>must</em> be explicitly async, since blocking the
main browser thread is not allowed.</p>
<h3>Implementation</h3>
<p>My attempts are in the repo: <a href="https://github.com/martindurant/async-zarr">https://github.com/martindurant/async-zarr</a>
This implements both async for normal python and for pyscript - they have the
same top-level functions, but different storage backends. The README shows how
to run the code, or you can look at a
<a href="https://nbviewer.org/github/martindurant/async-zarr/blob/main/example/notebook.ipynb">rendered notebook</a>.</p>
<p>Some notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>the code shamelessly subclasses from zarr, and replicated some of the
open functionality in zarr.core.</li>
<li>it's pretty short!</li>
<li>the CPython and pyodide storage backends are rather similar, except for relying
on <code>pyodide.http</code> and <code>aiohttp</code>, respectively</li>
<li>zarr metadata fetching is still sync, only data access is async. This was done
for expediency.</li>
</ul>
<h3>What next?</h3>
<p>There are <em>plenty</em> of issues to work out with bringing pydata IO to pyscript.
No other data library has solved this yet, and pyscript demos are having to jump
through many hoops or rely on text data only, which the whole threading/async
story stabilises.
However, my code is usable right now, and might well be useful in non-browser
async situations too. If we manage to figure out the API ad decent testing regime,
this package will be published and maybe upstreamed into zarr-python itself.</p>
