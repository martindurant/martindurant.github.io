  <p>Since the start of this year, I have been involved with the <a href="https://intake.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">Intake</a> project. Intake is all about how to describe and access data and building catalogs, but <strong>this</strong> article is about the GUI, which was built quickly with <a href="https://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">jupyter widgets</a> (formerly <code>ipywidgets</code>).</p>
<h2>The need for a GUI</h2>
<p>Without going into the details of Intake (please, read about it!), the need for a graphical interface alongside the programmatical one was recognised early on. The initial aim was to use <a href="https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">jupyter-lab,</a>, which is designed to allow for graphical/interactive panels alongside notebooks and interactive python sessions. However, extensions are written in typescript and require a build-and-deploy cycle to see the results of changes. I, to my shame, am no typescript programmer and I don't even know how the build system works, though doubtless I could begin <a href="https://github.com/jupyterlab/extension-cookiecutter-ts">here</a></p>
<h2>Jupyter Widgets to the rescue</h2>
<p>Fortunately, jupyter-widgets is <em>really simple</em>: you can instantiate in a cell and render the interactive output immediately. Because the notebook already ensures that the kernel is running and sets up comms between front- and back-ends, the user interaction logic is wholly python-side.</p>
<div class="hll"><pre><span></span><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">ipywidgets</span>
<span class="n">clicks</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">]</span>
<span class="n">button</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">ipywidgets</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">Button</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">description</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s1">&#39;Click me!&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">action</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="n">args</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="n">clicks</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">+=</span> <span class="mi">1</span>

<span class="n">button</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">on_click</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">action</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">button</span>
</pre></div>
<p>An appropriate button appears, and clicks are nicely collected in the <code>clicks</code> variable. Given the existence of layouts with <a href="https://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io/en/stable/examples/Widget%20Styling.html">flexible sizing</a>, where you can add and remove elements at will, this is starting to feel quite a lot like my <a href="https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/navigator/">earlier experience</a> with PyQT. Sure, there is no formal message-passing mechanism, but for simple enough interfaces, you can get by. You can even employ CSS within the elements for detailed styling.</p>
<h2>Forward</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://intake.readthedocs.io/en/latest/gui.html">resultant GUI</a> is already very useful, and required <a href="https://github.com/ContinuumIO/intake/blob/master/intake/gui/widgets.py">little code</a> to produce. It can yet be enhanced to do things like show a data extract or plots of the selected data-set, since you can embed other <code>display</code>-able elements or HTML such as produced by Bokeh.
Furthermore, the output can already be send to a separate panel in jupyter-lab using a <a href="https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/jupyterlab-sidecar">sidecar</a>.</p>
<p>However, there is no reason that this should be the only GUI for Intake. Come one, come all! If someone would like to help be typescript something for jupyter-lab, I would appreciate it, it would be nice to have a permanent data browser in the session not tied to a particular notebook.</p>
<p>Probably the rapidly developing <a href="https://panel.pyviz.org/user_guide/Widgets.html">panel</a> library will be able to produce a similarly flexible interface which can be run within or without a notebook, and integrates more naturally with bokeh tabular and graphical output.</p>
<p><strong>Summary</strong>: working with jupyter-widgets was remarkably smooth and easy, and I got to a useful, functional interface far faster than I had thought it would take.</p>
