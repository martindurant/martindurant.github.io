<p>Since it took me so long to make Intake "Take2" 2.0.0, I'll keep this post short.</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>So you have data that you want to do stuff with. Intake might be the connective
tissue you are after.</p>
<p>Intake was originally well received and found a small community of users. However it never
got the attention or popularity I thought it deserved. So, as one more attempt,
this is my effort to make it both simpler and more powerful and see if, in a crowded
marketplace, people want to give Intake a try.</p>
<h3>What Intake?</h3>
<p>Intake's moto has always been: "Taking the pain out of data access and distribution"
The main docs are at <a href="https://intake.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">https://intake.readthedocs.io/en/latest/</a> , so I won't repeat what is
written there; but the gist is, data is everything these days, and anything that can be
done to smooth how to locate, understand and load data, the more effective practitioners
(data scientists, engineers, AI/ML modelers, analysts) will be. In the typical scenario,
a given notebook or script has just some hard-coded URL/path, and the user has no idea
of the target's provenance.</p>
<p>Intake is all-python and likes talking to all the packages that make up the "PyData"
ecosystem (see <a href="https://numfocus.org/sponsored-projects">numfocus</a>, <a href="https://github.com/panstacks/pandata">pandata</a>
and others). These packages tend to focus on one thing at a time, and play nicely with
one-another with open protocols. However, there has been no data cataloguing standard.
Catalogs describe your datasets, providing metadata, so that you know which data
you need for a particular job, it's characteristics and how you might load it to
get things ready for analysis.</p>
<p>A data warehouse or service might have a catalogue (e.g., <a href="https://docs.databricks.com/en/data-governance/unity-catalog/index.html">unity</a>
for databricks) and even SQL servers have at least names for each table/view/query. In the
more python-specific world, we have <a href="https://docs.databricks.com/en/data-governance/unity-catalog/index.html">dlt</a>,
specialising in JSON-&gt;tabular, <a href="https://datasette.io/">datasette</a> for sqllite online queries
and <a href="https://datapackage.org/standard/specifications/">datapackage</a>. But these are specific
to platform, use case or datatype. Intake is the "everything" of data.</p>
<h3>Why Now?</h3>
<p>With the AI explosion, we know that CSV is not the only filetype, and indeed that tables
alone don't solve everything. Experience with the zarr project, and particularly
<a href="https://fsspec.github.io/kerchunk/">kerchunk</a> has shown me how complex multi-dimensional
array (tensor) sets can be, and <a href="https://awkward-array.org/">awkward</a> demonstrated
the importance of vectorised operations over nested, variable-length data. Defining
how to load such data can be complex!</p>
<p>In the meantime, <a href="https://www.dask.org/">dask</a> is not the only parallel compute
framework around. Ray, polars and others have shows great uptake with various lazy,
query-optimised and out-of-core workflows. Old Intake was tied to dask, which was a
fine choice at the time, but became more obviously outdated.</p>
<p>There was also <a href="https://github.com/intake/intake/issues/468">pushback</a> against the
complexity of creating new plugins for Intake, especially catalogue-producing ones.
It turns out, that many of the extra features of old Intake (caching, persistence,
path pattern matching, the server) were very rarely used and only complicated
developers' experience with Intake.</p>
<h3>How better?</h3>
<p>Intake will flourish in situations where:</p>
<ul>
<li>there are many datasets (so that finding the right one is a task)</li>
<li>datasets get updated centrally (so that users would frequently have to find the "latest")</li>
<li>many datatypes are needed for a job (if everything is a CSV, you only need one loading function)</li>
<li>users bother to create catalogs and share them (see Anaconda's aspirational
<a href="https://docs.anaconda.com/reusetext/notebook-data-catalog/">public catalog</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>I removed what was unnecessary complexity, but made everything more generic, and
so general-purpose. We don't depend on Dask, but any compute engine (spark, ray, duck, ...) can be and are
integrated: when a datatype is declared (even something simple like "CSV"), it
can be read with potentially several packages.</p>
<p>At its core, Intake is still "simple" and lightweight: it calls functions in other packages,
but gives pointers to users to help them make pipelines, and so easily create catalogs. You
can</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://intake.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api2.html#intake.readers.datatypes.recommend">discover</a> what type your data is</li>
<li><a href="https://intake.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api2.html#intake.readers.readers.reader_from_call">generate a reader</a> from a normal python line</li>
<li><a href="https://intake.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api2.html#intake.readers.datatypes.BaseData.possible_readers">show which readers</a> can read it</li>
<li><a href="https://intake.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api2.html#intake.readers.convert.auto_pipeline">find the path</a> from one type to any other we support</li>
<li>make pipelines using the same methods you normally would, even combining readers</li>
<li>add any reader to catalog with setitem</li>
<li>make new data types and readers with very minimal code</li>
</ul>
<p>And here's the current image of all the transforms we currently supports. You can't see the
detail, and that is the point:</p>
