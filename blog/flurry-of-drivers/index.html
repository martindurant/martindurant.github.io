<p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: the Intake <a href="https://intake.readthedocs.io/en/latest/plugin-directory.html">plugins directory</a>
has expanded recently, and no longer fits on a single page. Someone
(read: me) needs to start making categories and a TOC. This bodes
well for the continued growth of Intake uptake.</p>
<h2>Intake is...</h2>
<p>For those that have not come across it before, Intake is a python
package for describing, loading and disseminating datasets in
catalogues. Newcomers are encouraged to read the main <a href="https://intake.readthedocs.io">documentation</a>
and the quickstart there to understand how Intake can "take the pain out of
data access", whether for the data user, curators, developers or IT professionals.</p>
<p>Importantly for this discussion, Intake provides the <em>same API</em> for accessing catalogues
and data sources regardless of the backend, and provides metadata in a consistent
way. The more types of data we can access and catalogue, the richer the Intake landscape!</p>
<p>Although a number of "drivers" - classes specialising in loading a particular type
of data - are included in the main <code>intake</code> package, many more are provided in
optional extra packages. Some of these are owned by the Intake organisation, but many
are contributed by the community. A brief glimpse at <a href="https://intake.readthedocs.io/en/latest/plugin-directory.html">https://intake.readthedocs.io/en/latest/plugin-directory.html</a> 
show the currently known list, for those drivers that have specifically asked to
be included in the list. Some of these packages contain more than one driver.
This list has dynamically grown over time, and with
the addition of a few more over the past months, the list has become too long to
easily parse, and no longer a one-pager. This can only be good news for the
Intake ecosystem!</p>
<h2>New drivers</h2>
<p>Without further ado, here is a list of new drivers that have appeared recently, with
a brief description of each. <em>Most</em> of these have made it onto the list below, and some
are just too new for someone to have got around to including them! We include direct links
here for the ones that are not yet on the official list.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/informatics-lab/intake_informaticslab">intake-informaticslab</a> - this
first one hasn't even made it to the list yet! It enables cataloguing of large collections
of HDF5 files within structured path hierarchies, to be loaded by zarr by treating the
individual files as a chunks of a larger dataset</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/edjdavid/intake-excel">intake-excel</a> - just freshly released on PyPI,
expermiental new driver for loading batches of Excel sheets/files as single data sources</li>
<li>intake-metabase - connector to the open source business intelligence tool Metabase,
exposing the tables and queries you have defined, to be loaded into Python for analysis</li>
<li>intake-notebook - experimental driver to expose data outputs from running a notebook
with <code>papermill</code></li>
<li>intake-salesforce - connector to the tables and queries within a Salesforce deployment,
exposing customer records and interactions for analysis</li>
<li>intake-sklearn - catalogue and add metadata for fitted sklearn models, stored as
python pickle files</li>
<li>intake-stripe - access transaction information from your enterprise's payment system </li>
<li>intake-streamz - real-time event processing with complex logical flows, Dask and Pandas
integration and dynamic plotting via the <code>streamz</code> library</li>
<li>intake-thredds - scientific catalog THREDDS servers providing data listings and metadata and
endpoints (openDAP or absolute URLs) to xarray-compatible data. Used by the Pangeo
collaboration for climate/planetary data, along with intake-esm and intake-stac.</li>
<li>intake-rubicon - part of the <a href="https://github.com/capitalone/rubicon">Rubicon</a> project, a
tool for capturing logging and parameters of data science model builds and lifecycle.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Intake is alive and kicking! Writing drivers is easy, and Intake is proving itself as being
a great standardisation layer, to expose heterogeneous data collections to data 
practitioners.</p>
<h2>The future</h2>
<p>Look out for upcoming articles on intake-streamz and improvements to streamz in general!</p>
<p>Look out for detailed description and example of Intakes new 
<a href="https://intake.readthedocs.io/en/latest/transforms.html">transformation classes</a>!</p>
<p>Our friends at Brookhaven are developing a scalable, performant Intake server to
replace the current prototype included in Intake.</p>
