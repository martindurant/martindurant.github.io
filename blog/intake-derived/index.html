<p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: Intake now provides 
<a href="https://intake.readthedocs.io/en/latest/transforms.html?highlight=transform">derived datasets</a> with
a great deal of flexibility, so you are no longer restricted to ingesting data as provided by a
service or set of files. You can encode transforms and data cleaning as part of catalogues without
having to write a custom driver each time.</p>
<h2>Intake is...</h2>
<p>Intake is a python
package for describing, loading and disseminating datasets in
catalogues. Newcomers are encouraged to read the main <a href="https://intake.readthedocs.io">documentation</a>
and the quickstart there to understand how Intake can "take the pain out of
data access", whether for the data user, curators, developers or IT professionals.
It is one of my main work areas, so this is not the first blog on the topic!</p>
<p>Here, we describe a new feature to be able to describe new data sources
in terms of other data sources. This is a long-requested feature, now available in
beta for feedback.</p>
<h2>Recap</h2>
<p>Intake provides <em>catalogues</em>. which are collections of <em>data sources</em>. Catalogues can contain other
catalogues to form a hierarchical tree, and you could have several different views on some data,
whether it's the same data in different formats, or different loading parameters. All this has been
around a while. The data loads into one of several standard container types such as dataframe or array,
in memory or lazy. which the data scientist/analyst can then proceed to use with familiar methods,
e.g., Pandas calls.</p>
<h2>Impetus</h2>
<p>The idea for derived datasets has been around in Intake for a while - but we demurred on the basis that Intake
we supposed to be an ingest-only package.
However, the project <a href="https://github.com/holoviz/lumen"><code>lumen</code></a>, released by my Anaconda colleagues earlier this
year, showed how important "views" of a dataset were, at least for the case of visualisations in a dashboard.
Since that project showed a simple way to define transformations (e.g., selecting columns from a dataframe) that
was reminiscent of Intake YAML formalism.  Note that parameters for visualisations - which can include those
in the transform - are meant to be surfaced to the user in interactive GUI widgets.</p>
<p><code>lumen</code> does pull datasets from Intake specifications, as well 
as some custom APIs for,
for example, steaming datasets (see also: <a href="https://github.com/intake/intake-streamz"><code>intake-streamz</code></a>).
So the question becomes: at what point is a view useful only
for the purposes of providing a visualization, and when can that "view" actually be considered as a new
dataset.</p>
<p>We decided that it made sense to have both: that a datasource+transform is indeed another dataset,
and one should be able to catalogue it.</p>
<h2>Implementation</h2>
<p>We built the functionality and released it without much fanfare in Intake 0.6.2.
Documentation is <a href="https://intake.readthedocs.io/en/latest/transforms.html">here</a>. 
The main takeaways are:</p>
<ul>
<li>you can apply arbitrary functions to a dataset to create a new dataset</li>
<li>a transform class is like any other DataSource, except that it must declare an input container
type as well as the usual output one</li>
<li>by being able to call <code>to_dask</code>, <code>read</code> or any other load function on the input dataset, a transform
class defines the execution platform for the transform. It is up to the user, however, to ensure that
the implied compute resources (e.g., a Dask cluster) are available</li>
<li>some generic transforms are easily described by a single function, and so building out a list of useful
transforms (such as the column-selection example) would be easy. Distributing these would be as simple
as putting them in an installable python package - perhaps along with the catalogue that uses them.</li>
</ul>
<p>Exact integration with <code>lumen</code> is still an ongoing conversation, particularly around the question of
dynamic parameters (e.g., which columns can be picked, which depends on the current state of the input
dataset) and presenting interactive widgets to the user alongside graphical output. We will doubtless converge
to a clear separation of concerns. This would allow users, in the future, to experiment with data filters
and transforms, and then save their derived dataset into a catalogue to be shared with others.</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>What works</p>
<ul>
<li>using one of the pre-built classes to apply transformations to a data source</li>
<li>referring to data sources in other, potentially remote, catalogues</li>
<li>writing new transformations which specify their execution environment.</li>
</ul>
<p>What is planned:</p>
<ul>
<li>chaining transformations into explicit pipelines, with persistence stages</li>
<li>dynamically defining possible options for arguments to the transform, by introspecting the input dataset</li>
<li>datasets that depend on more than one source.</li>
</ul>
<p>What's missing:</p>
<ul>
<li>execution runtime managed by Intake configuration.</li>
</ul>
<h2>The future</h2>
<p>Basically, we're waiting for feedback on this feature. I'll be fascinated to find
out what kinds of uses people find for it.</p>
